# Roll-Dice-JS

Purpose of this project is to learn the basics javascript and DOM manipulation - by applying as many functions as possible

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in any of two dices, then it's the next player's turn
- BUT, if the player rolls  6 and 6, all his all score gets lost.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
